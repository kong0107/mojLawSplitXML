  B. Waste containers in direct contract with said chemical substances.
Ⅱ "Toxicity characteristic leaching" refers to industrial waste selected for analysis in accordance with the relationship between raw materials usage, manufacturing processes and waste ingredient characteristics, directly determined by Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (herein referred to as TCLP), or from extracted fluid determined as such after prior extraction and processing, and the density of whose ingredients exceeds the standards stated in Table 4.
Ⅲ "Dioxinous hazardous industrial waste" refers to industrial waste containing 17 chemical compounds of the same source as chloride dioxin 2,3,7,8 and furan, etc., with overall toxic equivalent concentration exceeding 1.0 ng I-TEQ/g.
Ⅳ "(PCB) hazardous industrial waste" refers to waste capacitors with a PCB content of over 50 per million (calculated by weight of insulating oil), waste transformers (calculated by weight of transformer oil), or other industrial waste.
