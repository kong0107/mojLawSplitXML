The retest shall be performed according to the following procedures:
22.1.1 The results of three retests for the original sample test vehicle shall be averaged to a single value (hereinafter referred to Y).
22.1.2 Y and all of the one-time retest results for each vehicle requested for retesting by the application entity and selected by the Competent Authority shall be averaged to determine a single value (hereinafter referred to X).
22.1.3 In the event that the difference of X and the product of statistical parameter times the standard deviation is not smaller than the Energy Efficiency Standards, the vehicles covered by the application shall be regarded as meeting the Energy Efficiency Standards. The standard deviation is calculated by the following equation:

The statistical parameters are to be determined based on the number of sample test vehicles, as in the following table:

If the number of sample test vehicles is equal to or greater than 20, then

22.2 In the event that the entity does not apply for retesting, or the results of the retesting do not meet the Energy Efficiency Standards under this Article, the certificate of conformity in respect to the vehicle or the model of vehicle covered by the certificate shall be annulled.
