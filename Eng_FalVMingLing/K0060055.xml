    <條號>Article 8</條號>
    <條文內容><![CDATA[The periodic costs of a jointly acquired asset shall be allocated to an Operator as follows:
a. When the total actual usage of all users（i.e. the Operator and its related parties） is greater than or equal to the total anticipated usage of all users, the periodic costs shall be allocated to the Operator based on the Operator's actual usage.
b. When the total actual usage of all users is smaller than the total anticipated usage of all users, the periodic costs shall be allocated to the Operator as follows:
1. If the actual usage of the Operator is greater than or equal to its anticipated usage, the periodic costs shall be allocated to the Operator based on its actual usage.
2. If the actual usage of the Operator is less than its anticipated usage, the Operator's allocation base equals the Operator's anticipated usage less the usage discrepancy adjustment. The usage discrepancy adjustment is the product of "the difference between the total actual usage and total anticipated usage of all "over-used" operators (meaning those users whose actual usage is greater than anticipated usage)" and "the ratio of dividing the difference between the operator's anticipated usage and actual usage by the difference between the total anticipated usage and total actual usage of all "under-used" operators, including the operator, (meaning those users whose anticipated usage is greater than actual usage)". Under this condition the allocation of the periodic costs is illustrated in an example below.
anticipated  usage                     actual usage
A            60                               40
B            30                               15
C            10                               20
Total        100                              75
the periodic costs of  A =  60 – (20 – 10) x   ( 60-40 )/[(60-40)+(30-15) ]
the periodic costs of  B =  30 – (20 – 10) x   ( 30-15 )/[(60-40)+(30-15) ]
The allocation of the periodic costs to a related party may follow the same methodology.
The periodic costs of a jointly acquired asset, as referred to in the first paragraph, comprises all asset-related charges such as operating costs and capital costs.
