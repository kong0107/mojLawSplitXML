    <條號>Article 4</條號>
    <條文內容><![CDATA[See the Attached Table 1 for the water quality items and limits prescribed in these Standards.
For the enterprises discharging wastewater to the special receiving water body in the water pollution total quantity control zone (“total quantity control zones” in brief) that has been announced by the special municipality, county or city competent authority for protecting the farmland water body, the regulations in Table 2 shall be applicable to the limits of copper, zinc, total chromium, nickel, cadmium and hexavalent chromium in the effluent. The regulations in table 2 shall not be applicable for the enterprises in the total quality control zones if the wastewater is discharged at a discharging point outside the total quality control zone through the attached pipelines along irrigation canals and all classes of water drainage channels, or jointly discharged through the pipelines, or if the wastewater is discharged at a discharging point in the total quality control zone but not to the special receiving water body.
