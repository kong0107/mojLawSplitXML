│A.The foam outlets of different types are defined as follows│
│  :                                                         │
│(1) Type I foam outlet: refers to an outlet through which   │
│    foam is injected from the upper part of a fixed-top     │
│    storage tank. It is located at the upper part of the    │
│    side plate of the storage tank, and is provided with    │
│    foam conduit or slide away and other auxiliary devices, │
│    which prevent the foam from submerging into the liquid  │
│    or agitating the liquid, and enable the foam to extin-  │
│    guish the fire effectively. In addition, a device is    │
│    provided to prevent the adverse flow of the public      │
│    hazardous materials inside the storage tank.            │
│(2) Type II foam outlet: refers to an outlet through which  │
│    foam is injected from a fixed top or the upper part of a│
│    storage tank. The outlet is attached with a foam reflec-│
│    ting plate, which makes the discharged foam flow along  │
│    the inner side of the side plate, prevents the foam from│
│    submerging into the liquid or agitating the liquid, and │
│    enables the foam to extinguish the fire effectively. In │
│    addition, a device is provided to prevent the back flow │
│    of the public hazardous materials inside the storage    │
│    tank.                                                   │
│(3) Special type foam outlet: refers to an outlet through   │
│    which foam is injected from the upper part of the outer │
│    floating top of a storage tank. The outlet is attached  │
│    with a foam reflecting plate, which enables the foam to │
│    be injected into the loop formed by the side plate of   │
│    storage tank and the foam separator plate. The separator│
│    plate is a steel plate installed more than 0.3m         │
│    (inclusive) above the floating top and more than 0.3m   │
│    (inclusive) away from the inner side of the storage tank│
│    , and it is provided with a device to prevent the foam  │
│    from flowing out and discharge the water effectively    │
│    depending on the expected maximum rainfall in the area  │
│    where the storage tank is set.                          │
│(4) Type III foam outlet: refers to an outlet through which │
│    foam is injected from the bottom of a fixed-top storage │
│    tank. A foam transmission pipe (designed with a struc-  │
│    ture or mechanism which can prevent the public hazardous│
│    materials inside the storage tank from flowing adversely│
│    through the pipe) is provided to transmit the foam gene-│
│    rated by the foam generator into the storage tank, and  │
│    discharge the foam through the outlet.                  │
│(5) Type IV foam outlet: refers to an outlet through which  │
│    foam is injected from the bottom of a fixed-top storage │
│    tank. The tail end of the foam transmission pipe is     │
│    connected to the special hose stored in the storage     │
│    cylinder (designed with a cover which is easy to break  │
│    off when foam is injected) located on the bottom under  │
│    the liquid surface; when foam is injected, the special  │
│    hose may be straightened to reach the front end of the  │
│    special hose to the liquid surface, so as to discharge  │
│    foam.                                                   │
│B.If a special type foam outlet is installed on a floating  │
│  top, installation of a foam reflecting plate shall be     │
│  exempted.                                                 │
│C.The Type III foam outlet in this table may be used only   │
│  for the tanks processing or storing the public hazardous  │
│  materials with a solubility of less than 1g in 100g of    │
│  water under a temperature of 20℃ (hereinafter "non-water-│
│  soluble substances" for short) and storing the public     │
│  hazardous materials with a temperature of less than 50 or │
│  with a dynamic viscosity of less than 100cst.             │
│D.For the storage tank of inner floating top adopted with   │
│  steel double deck or pantoon deck, the type and quantity  │
│  of the foam outlets may be configured similarly as storage│
│  tank of outer floating top                                │

│(1) Type I foam outlet: refers to an outlet through which   │
│    foam is injected from the upper part of a fixed-top     │
│    storage tank. It is located at the upper part of the    │
│    side plate of the storage tank, and is provided with    │
│    foam conduit or slide away and other auxiliary devices, │
│    which prevent the foam from submerging into the liquid  │
│    or agitating the liquid, and enable the foam to extin-  │
│    guish the fire effectively. In addition, a device is    │
│    provided to prevent the adverse flow of the public      │
│    hazardous materials inside the storage tank.            │
│(2) Type II foam outlet: refers to an outlet through which  │
│    foam is injected from a fixed top or the upper part of a│
│    storage tank. The outlet is attached with a foam reflec-│
│    ting plate, which makes the discharged foam flow along  │
│    the inner side of the side plate, prevents the foam from│
│    submerging into the liquid or agitating the liquid, and │
│    enables the foam to extinguish the fire effectively. In │
│    addition, a device is provided to prevent the back flow │
│    of the public hazardous materials inside the storage    │
│    tank.                                                   │
│(3) Special type foam outlet: refers to an outlet through   │
│    which foam is injected from the upper part of the outer │
│    floating top of a storage tank. The outlet is attached  │
│    with a foam reflecting plate, which enables the foam to │
│    be injected into the loop formed by the side plate of   │
│    storage tank and the foam separator plate. The separator│
│    plate is a steel plate installed more than 0.3m         │
│    (inclusive) above the floating top and more than 0.3m   │
│    (inclusive) away from the inner side of the storage tank│
│    , and it is provided with a device to prevent the foam  │
│    from flowing out and discharge the water effectively    │
│    depending on the expected maximum rainfall in the area  │
│    where the storage tank is set.                          │
│(4) Type III foam outlet: refers to an outlet through which │
│    foam is injected from the bottom of a fixed-top storage │
│    tank. A foam transmission pipe (designed with a struc-  │
│    ture or mechanism which can prevent the public hazardous│
│    materials inside the storage tank from flowing adversely│
│    through the pipe) is provided to transmit the foam gene-│
│    rated by the foam generator into the storage tank, and  │
│    discharge the foam through the outlet.                  │
│(5) Type IV foam outlet: refers to an outlet through which  │
│    foam is injected from the bottom of a fixed-top storage │
│    tank. The tail end of the foam transmission pipe is     │
│    connected to the special hose stored in the storage     │
│    cylinder (designed with a cover which is easy to break  │
│    off when foam is injected) located on the bottom under  │
│    the liquid surface; when foam is injected, the special  │
│    hose may be straightened to reach the front end of the  │
│    special hose to the liquid surface, so as to discharge  │
│    foam.                                                   │
│B.If a special type foam outlet is installed on a floating  │
│  top, installation of a foam reflecting plate shall be     │
│  exempted.                                                 │
│C.The Type III foam outlet in this table may be used only   │
│  for the tanks processing or storing the public hazardous  │
│  materials with a solubility of less than 1g in 100g of    │
│  water under a temperature of 20℃ (hereinafter "non-water-│
│  soluble substances" for short) and storing the public     │
│  hazardous materials with a temperature of less than 50 or │
│  with a dynamic viscosity of less than 100cst.             │
│D.For the storage tank of inner floating top adopted with   │
│  steel double deck or pantoon deck, the type and quantity  │
│  of the foam outlets may be configured similarly as storage│
│  tank of outer floating top                                │
