    <條號>Article 5</條號>
    <條文內容><![CDATA[When an enterprise applies for allocation of airport quota, it shall file an application with the CAA, along with its operation plan. The CAA shall ask other enterprises’ demands and equitably allocate such quota to the enterprise depending on actual demands.
If two or more enterprises file applications and the total amount of airport quota applied is higher than the amount of airport quota remaining unallocated, the CAA shall rate according to the enterprises’ operating plans to make the allocations mentioned in the preceding paragraph. The technical rating items of subparagraph 2 of paragraph 1 of Article 6 of Regulations Governing Allocation of International Air Traffic Rights and Charter Flights shall apply to do the previous rating and the calculation period of the safety assessment score is 2 years prior to the end of the month which the CAA asks the enterprises’ demands.
The CAA shall, when allocating the takeoff and landing quota, give preference to an enterprise that develops a regular route between Taiwan proper and such offshore island areas as Lienchiang County, Penghu County, Kinmen County and Lanyu Township and Lyudao Township of Taitung County, or between an offshore island and its offshore isles.
The CAA may give preference to an enterprise in allocating airport quotas as dictated by policy demands if the enterprise meets one of the following conditions:
1. It operates a regular offshore island route in such areas as Lienchiang County, Cimei Township and Wang-An Township of Penghu County or Lanyu Township and Lyudao Township of Taitung County; or
2. It is the enterprise that survived a merger or acquisition one (1) year after the date thereof.
If the airport quotas must be adjusted or reduced to meet the demands of public interests or military combats, exercises or trainings, the CAA may adjust or retract the airport quotas already allocated to the enterprises.
If the CAA plans to restore the adjusted or retracted airport quotas mentioned in the preceding paragraph, it shall give preference to the enterprises that originally used such airport quotas unless any of the circumstances set forth in Article 6 hereof occurs.

5. Within one (1) year after the occurrence of any aircraft accident; provided that the accident was apparently not attributable to the enterprise, as determined by the CAA’s Flight Safety Assessmant Committee.
If an enterprise may not participate in the allocation of airport quota due to the restrictions set forth in Item 5 of the preceding paragraph, but the accident investigation later determined that the accident was not attributable to the enterprise, such restrictions shall then be withdrawn.  If, during the period when such restrictions are imposed, additional allocation of airport quota is made and the said enterprise cannot acquire any quota because it is disqualified under such restrictions, the CAA may consider giving preference to the enterprise when making any allocation of airport quota in the future.

    <條號>Article 9</條號>
    <條文內容><![CDATA[The CAA may provide unused airport quota of an enterprise to another enterprise on a temporary basis if and when the runway needs an overhaul or any other emergency arises.
The enterprise may apply, to CAA, for additional airport quota, which is unused and available for a short term period, in order to meet a temporary market demand if its original allocated airport quota is insufficient, however, the additional airport quota shall not be used for more than six months during the whole year.
If any allocated airport quota is used on an air route that apparently has a peak season and a low season, and the average rate of its usage does not reach seventy percent (70%) for six consecutive months, the CAA may then retract the unused portion thereof.
In addition to an air route mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the CAA may also retract the unused portion of any airport quota whose average rate of usage does not reach eighty percent (80%) for six consecutive months.
Any unused portion of the airport quota that is not attributable to an enterprise will not be considered when calculating the rate of usage mentioned in the preceding two paragraphs.
The air route that apparently has a peak season and a low season as mentioned in Paragraph 3 hereof means one whose highest monthly average passenger capacity for three consecutive months during the past year is one and half times that of the lowest monthly average passenger capacity during the same period.
In the event that an enterprise terminates any of its domestic scheduled air routes, the CAA may retract its original allocated airport quota, wherein, such retracted airport quota thereto will be calculated based on the average quota of its usage of such air route in a period of six consecutive months prior to the actual termination month.
