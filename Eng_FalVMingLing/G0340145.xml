3.Where a related party or a nominal party meets the following items, such party's holding ratio of the foreign affiliated enterprise registered in a low-tax burden country or jurisdiction shall be calculated in accordance with the methods set forth in the preceding two subparagraphs, to be determined based on such party's aggregate holding ratio in the foreign affiliated enterprise registered in a low-tax burden country or jurisdiction:

4.If there is double calculation of the holding ratio of the profit-seeking enterprise's and its related party's direct or indirect holding in a foreign affiliated enterprise registered in a low-tax burden country or jurisdiction in accordance with preceding three subparagraphs, the higher ratio shall be considered.
Where the profit-seeking enterprise and its related parties have inappropriately circumvented the constituent elements in the preceding paragraph by share transfer or other arrangements before the settlement date of the annual accounts of the current year, the tax authority may determine the holding ratio of the shares or capital in the foreign affiliated enterprise registered in a low-tax burden country or jurisdiction based on the highest aggregate ratio on any day of the current year, to be calculated according to the methods provided in the subparagraphs of the preceding paragraph.
