The grinding wheel for testing in the preceding paragraph shall be taken over 10 percent of that products. For a number below five, the five is concerned .
If all tested grinding wheels are normal, the lot is qualified. If abnormal rate below 5 percent, the others of the lot are qualified except the abnormals. However, significantly abnormal products cannot be included in the number of that test.
Grinding wheels shall implement a regular rotation- breaking test following the next paragraph. The qualified wheels can exemple the rotation test in the first paragraph. Failed grinding wheels in the regular rotation-breaking test shall be treated according to the second paragraph.
The regular rotation-breaking test is implemented by taking more than three grinding wheels having the same kind of bonder and being used in the normal velocity.If the minimum rotation-breaking peripheral velocity get from the test is over the highest using velocity multiplied by 1.8 in case of machine-grinding except coarse grinding , or over that mulitiplied by 2 in case of other grinding, those products having this kind of bonder and being used in normal velocity are qualified.
