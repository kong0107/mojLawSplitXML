    <條號>Article 6</條號>
    <條文內容><![CDATA[In these Standards, the definitions of “general waste” and “industrial waste” are based on relevant regulations of the Waste Disposal Act. Pollutants produced by industrial units may be controlled in accordance with the General Waste Incinerator Emission Standards if the competent authority has authorized their disposal in a general waste incinerator.

    <條號>Article 10</條號>
    <條文內容><![CDATA[The concentrations of all types of pollutants in stack emissions shall be calculated based on non-diluted dry emission volumes at a temperature of 273K and a pressure of 1 atmosphere. A 11% oxygen concentration shall serve as the reference standard. The correction formula is as follows:
    21-11
C = ───* Cs
    21- Os

When the oxygen concentration of air introduced into an oxygen-enriched combustion system exceeds 21%, an oxygen concentration of 11% shall serve as the reference standard for emissions gases.
The correction formula is as follows:
    E-11
C = ───* Cs
    E- Os

If the values in the foregoing two paragraphs (21-Os) or (E-Os) are less than 1, they shall be calculated as 1.

    <條號>Article 11</條號>
    <條文內容><![CDATA[In these Standards, “existing incinerator” means:
I. Construction was completed before December 2, 1992; and documentary proof thereof can be provided.
II. Construction has been under way, project tender procedures were completed, or if no tenders were invited, project contracts were issued and signed before December 2, 1992. Moreover, such documentary proof was already submitted to the competent authority before March 1, 1993 in applying for verification and approval.
