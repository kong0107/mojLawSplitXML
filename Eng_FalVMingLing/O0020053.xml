    <條號>Article 2</條號>
    <條文內容><![CDATA[Terms used in these Regulations are defined as follows.
1. "Initial inspection and testing" means the air pollution inspection and testing performed on a motor vehicle included in a specially designated engine family or vehicle model when an in-use motor vehicle undergoes recall and correction inspection and testing.
2. "Confirmation inspection and testing" means pollution inspection and testing performed to further confirm pollution emissions results when a motor vehicle included in a specially designated engine family or vehicle model fails to meet emissions standards during initial inspection and testing.
3. "Restoration and maintenance" means, for the performance of maintenance work on tested motor vehicles, the adjustment of motor vehicle parameters required to be performed in accordance with the contents of the vehicle owner's manual and motor vehicle exhaust control information labeling submitted when applying to the central competent authority for vehicle model exhaust testing compliance verification for the said engine family.
4. "Voluntary recall and correction" means a motor vehicle manufacturer or importer directly notifies the motor vehicle owner to make corrections for the failure to meet emissions standards due to the determination through the process of initial inspection and testing that there is concern of an air pollutant emitted by the motor vehicle failing to meet emissions standards or that the adopted pollutant-related components are the reason causing the failure to meet emissions standards.
5. "Compulsory recall and correction" means the central competent authority orders a motor vehicle manufacturer or importer to notify the motor vehicle owner to make corrections for the failure to meet emissions standards due to the failure during confirmation inspection and testing to meet emissions standards or the failure to report voluntary recall and correction in accordance with regulations.
6. "Verification testing" means testing during the review of a recall and correction plan that motor vehicle manufacturers and importers are ordered to perform on motor vehicles, engines or components in order to confirm that the correction measures of the plan possess improvement effectiveness and are capable of bringing the motor vehicle into compliance with emissions standards.
