    <條文內容><![CDATA[Water quality items and limits for effluent standards for enterprises, sewage systems and building sewage treatment facilities are as follows in the table 1.
For the enterprises and sewage systems discharging wastewater to the special receiving water body in the water pollution total quantity control zone (“total quantity control zones” in brief) that has been announced by the special municipality, county or city competent authority for protecting the farmland water body, the regulations in Table 2 shall be applicable to the limits of copper, zinc, total chromium, nickel, cadmium and hexavalent chromium in the effluent. The regulations in table 2 shall not be applicable for the enterprises and sewage systems in the total quality control zones if the wastewater is discharged at a discharging point outside the total quality control zone through the attached pipelines along irrigation canals and all classes of water drainage channels, or jointly discharged through the pipelines, or if the wastewater is discharged at a discharging point in the total quality control zone but not to the special receiving water body.
If the enterprises and sewage systems have designated effluent standards shall be applicable.
