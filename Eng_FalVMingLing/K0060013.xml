    <條文內容><![CDATA[Stations using radiotelephony shall be identified in accordance with the following rules:
1.Coast Station: Use a call sign or the geographic name of the location of station, followed by the word “RADIO” or other proper indication.
2.Ship Station: Use a call sign or the official name of the ship. When necessary, on the condition of not causing confusion to distress, emergency or safety signals, one may add name of owner or company to the name of the ship, or add its selective calling number or signals; if there are visual or audio identification signals, those signals shall be consistent with the call sign of the station.
3.Ship Survival Craft Station: Use a call sign or a signal of identification consisting of the name of the parent ship followed by two digits.
4.Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon Station: Use the name and call sign of parent ship of radio beacon when using voice transmission.
5.Aeronautical Station: Use name of airport or the geographical name of its location. When necessary, one may continue with additional and appropriate wording indicating the station’s mission.
6.Aircraft Station: Use the name of aircraft owner or model number in front of the calling number, or adopt words composed of letters which are consistent with official registered mark of that aircraft or a word identifying airline company, followed by flight identification number. Also if aircraft stations, after using whole calling number to communicate with each other, have no concern for causing misunderstanding, one may use the first character and last two letters of the five characters in telex to replace five-character calling number, or the first character of whole calling number or the abbreviation of the name of owner of aircraft (company or individual) or type of aircraft followed by last two letters of the whole calling number, or use the last two characters of its registered mark in telephone calls.
7.Aircraft Survival Craft Station: Use a call sign.
8.Base Station: Use calling number, or the geographic name of the location. It may be followed by any other proper indication if necessary.
9.Land Mobile Station: Use calling number, or vehicle itself or any other proper indication. The language used for identification as referred in the preceding paragraph must be clear, and Mandarin shall be used in domestic communication.

    <條文內容><![CDATA[When selective calling equipment is used in maritime mobile service, the assignment of calling number shall be made in accordance with the followings:
1.The compositions of the selective calling numbers of the ship station and the identification numbers of the coast station:
(1)The selective calling number shall be composed of ten numbers ranging from 0 to 9.
(2)The identification number of coast station shall be composed of four digits. But the composition can not be started with “00”.
(3)The selective calling number of the ship station shall be composed of five digits.
(4)For predetermined groups of ship stations, it is composed of five repetitious digits, or is composed of five digits formed by two different digits repeated alternately.
2.The assignment of the selective calling number of ship station and the selective identification number of coast station: When it is necessary to use the selective calling number of ship station and the selective identification number of coast station in maritime mobile service; and when the selective calling system conforms to the selective calling system of international maritime mobile service set forth in Appendix 39 of Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union, the selective calling number and the coast station identification number shall be selected from the allocated international series numbers and allocate them to the ship station and coast station in accordance with ITU-R Recommendation M.257-3.
