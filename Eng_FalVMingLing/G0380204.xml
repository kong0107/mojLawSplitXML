The product suitability policy mentioned in subparagraph 1 of the preceding paragraph shall include at least categories of risk tolerance levels for non-professional investors and risk levels for individual products, in order that the trust enterprise may use the non-professional investor's risk tolerance level as a basis for recommending or investing through trust in products appropriate to that risk tolerance level.
