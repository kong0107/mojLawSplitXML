1.Installation of renewable energy power generation equipment: Calculation is based on the installed capacity.
2. Purchase of renewable energy and certificate: The annual purchase amount required is calculated by multiplying the compulsory installed capacity by the annual amount of electricity sales per kW for the selected category of renewable energy (based on the annual amount of electricity sales measured in kW in the Appendix).
3. Installation of energy storage facility: The installed capacity is calculated by multiplying the compulsory installed capacity by the minimum power supply duration of two hours.
The capacity and purchase amount specified in the preceding paragraph are calculated based on the renewable energy power generation equipment, authorized by the electricity license, the self-use power generation equipment registration or the renewable energy facility registration document, the energy storage facility approved by the central competent authority, or the purchase of renewable energy and certificate.
For those who setting up renewable energy power generation equipment by themselves, the electricity generated shall be used by the compulsory user of renewable energy or other power user who is considered as the same legal person.
