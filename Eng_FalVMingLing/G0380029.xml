    <條號>Article 5</條號>
    <條文內容><![CDATA[When the obligee gives notice to stop payment of a negotiable instrument pursuant to Article 18 of the Act, he shall fill out a stop payment notice for the lost instrument, specifying the following particulars, and bring it to the drawee's notice:
1. The circumstances by which the negotiable instrument was lost.
2. The type, account number, serial number, and sum payable of the lost instrument, and any other relevant entries on the lost instrument.
3. The name, age, and domicile of the person who gives notice to stop payment. If the person is an agency or group, its official seal shall also be affixed to the notice. If the person is a company or business, the notice shall further be signed by the responsible person. If the person is an individual, his national ID number shall be indicated in the notice. When the obligee is the drawer, the obligee's original seal or signature of record shall be affixed.
Upon receipt of a stop payment notice for a negotiable instrument, the drawee shall immediately ascertain whether it is accurate. If the obligee has no funds on deposit and approval has not been given for a credit advance on the instrument, the drawee shall decline to entertain the notice. If the obligee's funds on deposit are insufficient or the instrument exceeds the amount approved by the drawee for credit advance, the drawee shall first stop payment within the amount of the funds on deposit or the amount approved for credit advance. If subsequently there are further funds on deposit or further approval is given for a credit advance, the drawee shall continue to stop payment thereof within the limit of the amount indicated on the negotiable instrument for which the stop payment notice was given. 
When the obligee gives notice to stop payment of a negotiable instrument before its date of maturity, the drawee shall first register the stop payment notice, and then upon the maturity date shall proceed as provided in the preceding paragraph. The same shall apply if the notice to stop payment of a check is given before the date of drawing indicated on the check.
When notice is given to stop payment of a blank negotiable instrument that has been signed but that does not specify in full the particulars required to be specified thereon, if the particulars are supplemented in full after the loss of the instrument, the preceding two paragraphs shall apply mutatis mutandis, and the drawee shall stop payment within the limit of the amount indicated on the instrument.
The sum on which payment is stopped shall be retained by the drawee, and may not be paid or otherwise drawn upon by the drawer unless in accordance with Article 19, paragraph 2 of the Act, or with the consent of both the possessor of the instrument and the person who gave the stop payment notice.
