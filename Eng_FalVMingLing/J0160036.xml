    <條文內容><![CDATA[Definitions of terminologies used in this Regulations are as follows:
1. Nuclear safeguards materials are classified below:
i. Uranium or uranium-containing materials; uranium-containing materials refers to materials with a weight percentage of uranium no less than 0.05%.
ii. Plutonium or plutonium-containing materials.
iii.Thorium or thorium-containing materials; thorium-containing materials refers to materials with a weight percentage of thorium no less than 0.05%.
iv. Deuterium or deuterium-containing materials: deuterium, heavy water (deuterium oxide), or other deuterated compounds that are used in a nuclear reactor and have been imported or exported consecutively for 12 months, which weigh more than 200 kg and have a weight percentage of deuterium and hydrogen nuclei no less than 0.02%.
v. Those materials other than the above four types designated by the competent authorities to be included as nuclear safeguards materials.
2. Effective kilogram, a special unit in weight used in safeguarding nuclear materials of uranium (including enriched uranium, natural uranium, or depleted uranium), plutonium, or thorium, is calculated based on the following computation formulas:
i. Uranium with a weight percentage in the uranium-235 isotope of 1% or above, the quantity in effective kilograms is the product of the Uranium weight in kilograms multiplied by the square of the weight percentage in the uranium-235 isotope.
ii. Uranium with a weight percentage in the uranium-235 isotope of between 1% and 0.5%, the quantity in effective kilograms is the product of the Uranium weight in kilograms multiplied by 0.0001.
iii.Uranium with a weight percentage in the uranium-235 isotope of below 0.5%, the quantity in effective kilograms is the product of  the Uranium weight in kilograms multiplied by 0.00005.
iv. Uranium containing uranium-233, the computation formulas for effective kilograms are the same as those for uranium-235.
v. Plutonium, the quantity in effective kilograms is its weight in kilograms.
vi.Thorium, the quantity in effective kilograms is the product of its weight in kilograms multiplied by 0.00005.
3. Nuclear safeguards facilities are defined as follows:
i. Research, power generation, or other nuclear reactor facilities.
ii.Production or storage facilities for nuclear source materials or nuclear fuels; facilities for management, storage, or final disposal of spent fuel.
iii.Facilities storing nuclear safeguards materials in excess of one effective kilogram or any other locations designated by the competent authorities.]]></條文內容>
