3.A natural-person shareholder who holds shares, together with those held by the person's spouse, minor children, or held by the person under others' names, in an aggregate amount of one percent or more of the total number of issued shares of the company or ranking in the top 10 in holdings.

7.A professional individual who, or an owner, partner, director, supervisor, or officer of a sole proprietorship, partnership, company, or institution that, provides commercial, legal, financial, accounting services or consultation to the company or to any affiliate of the company, or a spouse thereof; provided, this restriction does not apply to a member of the remuneration committee, public tender offer review committee, or special committee for merger/consolidation and acquisition, who exercises powers pursuant to the Act or to the Business Mergers and Acquisitions Act or related laws or regulations.
The requirement of the preceding paragraph in relation to "during the two years before being elected" does not apply where an independent director of a public company has served as an independent director of the company or any of its affiliates, or of a specified company or institution that has a financial or business relationship with the company, as stated in subparagraph 2 or 6 of the preceding paragraph, but is currently no longer in that position.

The shareholdings of any of the aforesaid persons include the shares held by the spouse or any minor child of the person or by the person under others' names.
3.It and its group companies are the source of 30 percent or more of the operating revenue of the public company.
4.It and its group companies are the source of 50 percent or more of the total volume or total purchase amount of principal raw materials (those that account for 30 percent or more of total procurement costs, and are indispensable and key raw materials in product manufacturing) or principal products (those accounting for 30 percent or more of total operating revenue) of the public company.
For the purposes of paragraph 1 and the preceding paragraph, the terms "parent", "subsidiary", and "group" shall have the meanings as determined under International Financial Reporting Standards 10.]]></條文內容>

When calling a shareholders' meeting for the purpose of independent director elections, the board of directors, or other person having the authority to call a shareholders' meeting, shall review the qualifications of each independent director nominee; except under any of the following circumstances, all qualified nominees shall be included in the slate of independent director candidates:
1.Where the nominating shareholder submits the nomination at a time not within the published period for receiving nominations.
2.Where the shareholding of the nominating shareholder is less than one percent at the time of book closure by the company under Article 165, paragraph 2 or 3 of the Company Act.
3.Where the number of nominees exceeds the number of independent directors to be elected.
4.Where the relevant documentary proof required under the preceding paragraph is not attached.
If an independent director candidate included by a public company under the provisions of the preceding paragraph has already served as an independent director of the public company for three consecutive terms or more, the company shall publicly disclose, together with the review results under the preceding paragraph, the reasons why the candidate is nominated again for the independent directorship, and present the reasons to the shareholders at the time of the election at the shareholders meeting.
The directors of the public company shall be elected in accordance with Article 198 of the Company Act, with independent and non-independent directors elected at the same time, but in separately calculated numbers.
