    <條文內容><![CDATA[For a retired staff member receiving all of their retirement payment as a monthly pension, the preferential savings deposit interest rate (hereunder abbreviated to "preferential interest rate") for a Civil Servant and School Staff Insurance lump-sum old-age payment shall be handled in accordance with the following provisions:
1. From 1 July 2018 to 31 December 2020, the annual interest rate will be nine percent.
2. From 1 January 2021, the annual interest rate will be zero.
For a staff member referred to in the preceding paragraph, apart from those receiving a reduced monthly retirement pension, if, after the preferential interest on their Civil Servant and School Staff Insurance lump-sum old-age payment deposit has been calculated in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, their monthly retirement income is lower than the maximum final-year replacement rate amount stipulated in Article 37 and Schedule 3, for the portion of that amount that is the preferential interest on a Civil Servant and School Staff Insurance lump-sum old-age payment deposit, the amount of preferential interest that may be paid on that Civil Servant and School Staff Insurance lump-sum old-age payment deposit shall be calculated at an annual interest rate of 18 percent. If, however, the monthly retirement income that is calculated in accordance with the provisions in place before this Act came into force (hereunder referred to as the "monthly retirement income based on the former provisions") is lower than the final-year maximum replacement rate amount stipulated in Article 37 and Schedule 3, the preferential interest on savings deposits will be organized based on the original deposit amount and an annual interest rate of 18 percent.
If the monthly retirement income calculated in accordance with the provisions of the preceding two paragraphs and Articles 37 to 39 is lower than or equal to the minimum guaranteed amount, for the portion of the minimum guaranteed amount that is preferential interest on a Civil Servant and School Staff Insurance lump-sum old-age payment deposit, the amount of preferential interest that may be paid on that Civil Servant and School Staff Insurance lump-sum old-age payment deposit shall be calculated at an annual interest rate of 18 percent. If, however, the monthly retirement income based on the former provisions is lower than the minimum guaranteed amount, the preferential interest on savings deposits will be calculated based on the original deposit amount and an annual interest rate of 18 percent.
If a retired staff member receives a lump-sum retirement payment, the preferential interest rate on the lump-sum retirement payment and the Civil Servant and School Staff Insurance lump-sum old age payment shall be handled in accordance with the following provisions:
1. If the monthly preferential interest on the combined total of the lump-sum retirement payment and the Civil Servant and School Staff Insurance lump-sum old-age payment is higher than the minimum guaranteed amount:
(1) Interest on the amount of the principal corresponding to the preferential interest on an amount equivalent to the minimum guaranteed amount will accrue at an annual interest rate of 18 percent.
(2) The preferential interest on the principal corresponding to the preferential interest that exceeds the minimum guaranteed amount will be handled in accordance with the following provisions:
1. From 1 July 2018 to 31 December 2020, the annual interest rate will be twelve percent.
2. From 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2022, the annual interest rate will be ten percent.
3. From 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2024, the annual interest rate will be eight percent.
4. From 1 January 2025, the annual interest rate will be six percent.
2. If the monthly preferential interest on the combined total of the lump-sum retirement payment and the Civil Servant and School Staff Insurance lump-sum old-age payment is lower than or equal to the minimum guaranteed amount, preferential interest on the principal will accrue at an annual interest rate of 18 percent.
If a retired staff member receives half of their retirement payment as a monthly pension, it shall be handled in accordance with the following provisions:
1. The provisions of Paragraph 1 apply to any Civil Servant and School Staff Insurance lump-sum old-age payment deposit amount enjoying preferential interest that is obtained on a pro-rata basis, in proportion with the monthly pension received as half of the retirement payment. But the minimum guaranteed amount, and the maximum final-year replacement rate amount referred to in Paragraph 2, shall be calculated on a pro-rata basis in proportion with the monthly retirement pension payments they are also receiving.
2. The provisions of the preceding paragraph apply to the preferential interest that may be arranged for savings deposits of the lump-sum retirement payment received as half of the retirement entitlement, plus any Civil Servant and School Staff Insurance lump-sum old-age payment deposit amount drawing preferential interest that is received on a pro-rata basis to that lump-sum retirement payment. The minimum guaranteed amount, however, shall be calculated on a pro-rata basis in proportion with the lump-sum retirement payment received.]]></條文內容>

This restriction does not apply, however, if the survivor chooses to waive the regular payment that they are personally entitled to receive, and the authority responsible for the distribution of that regular payment agrees.
After a deceased retired staff member's survivor has chosen a survivor annuity in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 1, if receipt of the survivor annuity is to be terminated because the survivor dies or because there is some other statutory cause for termination of the survivor annuity, the deceased retired staff member's distributable lump-sum retirement payment shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article.

1. Lump-sum bereavement compensation.
2. Lump-sum bereavement compensation and monthly bereavement compensation.
The payment of the bereavement compensation referred to in the preceding paragraph will be calculated using the following standards:
1. If the staff member was employed for less than 15 years, lump-sum bereavement compensation will be paid in accordance with the following provisions:
(1) If the staff member was employed for at least 10 years but less than 15 years, one and a-half base units will be awarded for each year of service; for any number of months less than one year, one-eighth of a base unit shall be awarded per month; any period of less than one month will be counted as one full month.
(2) If the staff member was employed for less than 10 years, apart from paying bereavement compensation in accordance with the provisions of the preceding item, an additional one-twelfth of a base unit shall be awarded for each of the number of months that is short of 10 years, up to a maximum of 9 and 11/12ths base units, after which no further additional units will be awarded (as shown in Schedule 4). If, however, the staff member has previously received a separation payment in accordance with ordinances paid using a government budget allocation or from the Pension Fund or has been paid the Pension Fund contributions and interest, the associated years of service will be included in the staff member's aggregate years of service. If the number of years aggregated exceeds ten years, no further additional units will be awarded.
2. If the employee was employed for at least 15 years, lump-sum bereavement compensation and monthly bereavement compensation will be paid in accordance with the following provisions:
(1) Monthly bereavement compensation of one-half of a base unit will be paid each month.

For the portion exceeding 15 years, an additional one-half of a base unit will be awarded for each additional year, up to a maximum of 27 and 1/2 base units. For any months short of one year, 1/24th of a base unit will be awarded; any period of less than one month will be counted as one month.
