    <條號>Article 7</條號>
    <條文內容><![CDATA[The clean-up and handling of oil pollution in intertidal zones within the marine environment, due to the special characteristics of these zones, shall, in addition to taking into consideration natural restoration methods, give priority to the following methods based on the special characteristics of the intertidal zone:
1. For those intertidal zones that are sand beaches:
(1) After the oil slick has congealed, tar balls and oil-contaminated sand shall be excavated by manual or mechanical methods; excavated tar balls and oil-contaminated sand shall be properly disposed of in order to avert secondary pollution.
(2) Sand contaminated with small quantities of oil may be rinsed with water and then such materials as oil-absorbing cotton may be used to absorb oil or oil dispersants used to break-up the oil.
(3) The use of oil dispersants in the foregoing subparagraph shall comply with Article 5 of these Regulations.
2. For those intertidal zones that consist of small rocks:
(1) The clean-up of oil pollution contaminating the upper layer of small rocks may be performed by excavation by manual or mechanical methods; excavated tar balls and oil-contaminated small rocks shall be properly disposed of in order to avert secondary pollution.
(2) When there is concern, due to the impact of waves, of oil pollution penetrating into deeper layers of an oil-contaminated small rock shoreline, oil dispersants may be used for the clean-up and handling of the oil pollution between high tide and low tide.
(3) The use of oil dispersants in the foregoing subparagraph shall comply with Article 5 of these Regulations.
3. For those intertidal zones that are wetlands:
Containment methods shall be used to prevent the oil pollution from floating into the zone, and manual labor used to remove the oil pollution or small, simple tools used to clean-up the oil pollution; large machinery that could cause damage to the wetlands and impact biological organisms in the area may not be used for clean-up.
4. For those intertidal zones that are estuaries:
Containment methods shall be used to prevent the oil pollution from floating into the zone, and absorbent material, to be spread evenly over the pollution site, used; the absorbent material, after absorbing the oil, shall be removed manually or mechanically; the clean-up of the oil pollution may not impact biological organisms in the area.
5. For those intertidal zones that are coral reefs:
Containment methods shall be used to prevent the oil pollution from floating into the zone, and manual methods for skimming used or absorbent material, to be spread evenly over the pollution site, used; the absorbent material shall be removed manually; after residual oil pollution has been rinsed with water, such materials as oil-absorbing cotton may be used to absorb oil; the clean-up of the oil pollution shall not impact biological organisms in the area.
