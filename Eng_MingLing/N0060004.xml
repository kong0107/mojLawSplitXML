    <條號>Article 2</條號>
    <條文內容><![CDATA[The Employer shall limit the concentration of hazardous substances in air of workplace not exceeding the provisions in Attachment 1 or Attachment 2. If the hazardous substances whose permissible exposure limits are not given in Attachment 1 are detected, it shall be deemed as exceeding the standard.

  <條文>
    <條號>Article 3</條號>
    <條文內容><![CDATA[The permissible exposure limits are specified herein as follows:
1. The time weighted average for an 8-hour workday: the 8-hour time weighted average concentration for any substances without designation of "Ceiling" in Attachment 1, to which it is believed that workers may be repeatedly exposed for a daily usual work of 8 hours, without adverse effect.
2. The time weighted average for short term exposure: For any substance without designation of "Ceiling " in Attachment 1 and any substance listed in Attachment 2, the time weighted average for short term exposure shall be calculated by multiplying the "8-hour time weighted average" by an corresponding "Excursion Factor" listed in the following Attachment. This is the concentration to which it is believed that workers can be continuously exposed for any 15 minutes without suffering from irritation, chronic or irreversible tissue damage, or narcosis of sufficient degree to increase accidental injury or reduce work efficiency.

3. Ceiling Permissible Density: An employee's exposure to a substance designated by " Ceiling" in Attachment 1 shall not exceed, at any time during an ordinary 8-hour shift, the Ceiling Permissible Density given for the substance in the Attachment so as to prevent the employee from suffering unbearable irritation or physical impairment.
