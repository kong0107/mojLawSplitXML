    <條文內容><![CDATA[Where the quality condition of a drug is changed or the quality condition of a drug is deemed as questionable by the competent authority, the reimbursement price shall be handled as follows:
1. If failure to obtain a certificate of “consisting of DMF-filed active pharmaceutical
ingredient” issued by the competent authority when a raw material is replaced, approval of free sale by FDA/EMA is cancelled, user-friendly packaging or standard packaging no longer exists, or any of the related the certificates expired or was revoked:
(1) The item will be designated with a new NHI Code and re-priced according to the quality conditions that the item currently meets with the new price no more than the original NHI reimbursement price. In the event that there is no drug of the same quality conditions and class in the same group, 80% of the original NHI reimbursement price shall be used for pricing.
(2) The effectiveness of the re-designation of the NHI Code and drug price shall conform to the new item set forth in the Schedule. The original NHI reimbursement price shall be re-set to zero. Regarding the effective date of the new price, a one-month grace period shall be given between the public announcement of the new drug price by the insurer and the effective date of the new drug price.
2. If a drug manufacturer has been identified as having critical deficiencies of GMP for two consecutive times by the competent authority according to the results of inspection, the payment of the related items will be temporarily suspended, a one-month grace period shall be given between the notification of suspension of payment by the insurer and the effective date of the suspension. Where the competent authority has approved the manufacturer’s application for re-inspection, the manufacturer shall submit the documents approved by or filed to the competent authority to the insurer. A postmarked date when the insurer receives the documents counts. If the said documents are received prior to the 10th day (inclusive) of the current month, the original NHI reimbursement price will be reinstated on the first day of the following month； if the said documents are received out of above period, the original NHI reimbursement price will be reinstated on the first day of the second month after the receipt of the said documents. If the drug manufacturer commits serious breach again (i.e. three consecutive times) or fails to remedy the previous breach within the stipulated time, the NHI reimbursement will be revoked.
3. In the event that the competent authority notifies the insurer by letter that GMP certificate of a drug manufacturer is revoked, a one-month grace period shall be given to the items involved between the notification of suspension of payment by the insurer and the effective date of the suspension. If the manufacturer fails to issue any objection and submits the transfer document of manufacturing license certified by or filed to the competent authority within six months after the suspension of payment, the NHI reimbursement for the item shall be cancelled.
4. If the level of hazard of a drug is classified into Class I or Class II according to the Directions on Implementation of Recall Action of Pharmaceuticals and is not   produced by the manufacturer which has been identified as having critical deficiencies of GMP for two consecutive times as set forth in Subparagraph 2, the following shall apply:
(1) The effective date of the temporary suspension of payment shall conform to the following:
 Class I hazard: the temporary suspension of payment shall take effect on the next day after the competent authority issues the notifying letter to the insurer;
 Class II hazard: a three-month grace period in relation to the temporary suspension of payment shall be given from the next day after the competent authority issues the notifying letter to the insurer. Where the competent authority notifies and stipulates a deadline for a recall action, the temporary suspension of payment shall take effect on the first day of the month following the deadline for the said recall action.
(2) The conditions for terminating the temporary suspension of payment or reinstating the original NHI reimbursement price are set forth below:
 If the level of hazard is classified into Class I and the competent authority has approved the completion of the recall action of the questionable drug and notified the insurer, the date of issued letter by the competent authority shall be used to determine the effective date. Where the said letter is issued before the 10th day of the month (inclusive), the original NHI reimbursement price will be reinstated on the 1st day of the following month； if the said letter is issued out of above period, the original NHI reimbursement price will be reinstated on the 1st day of the second month after the issuance of the said letter.
 If the level of hazard is classified into Class II and the competent authority has approved the completion of the recall action of the questionable drug and notified the insurer, the date of issued letter by the competent authority shall be used to determine the effective date.

Drugs of which the patents expire or which are not patented are further divided into the following two categories: the first category includes drugs from original R&D pharmaceutical companies, drugs of which the process of pharmaceutical form complies with PIC/S GMP requirements, BA/BE generic drugs, drugs approved to by FDA/EMA for free sale, controlled items of BE generic drugs whereas the second category includes common generic drugs which do not fall into the first category.
3. The adjustment of the drug reimbursement price:
(1) Adjustment period calculation: between the effective date of the most recent adjustment of the reimbursement price and the end date of the survey.
(2) Adjustment method for drugs within the term of patent:
1. If the WAP is greater or equal to the pre-adjustment reimbursement price multiplied by 0.85, no adjustment shall be made. If the WAP is less than the pre-adjustment reimbursement price multiplied by 0.85, the reimbursement price shall be adjusted to “the pre-adjustment reimbursement price” multiplied by 0.15 plus the “WAP.” The formula for adjusting the drug price is:
(1)WAP ≧ (1-R) × Pold: no adjustment is required
(2)WAP ＜ (1- R) × Pold: adjusted according to the following formula:
Pnew=WAP+ Pold × R

If the price of an item is lower than 70% of the highest price (exclusive), the NHI reimbursement price of such item shall be adjusted to 70% of the highest price. Notwithstanding, the new drug price may not be higher than the reimbursement price prior to the adjustment.
5. Newly-listed items: shall refer to items of which the effective date of listing is within six months from the survey deadline and which conform to the following requirements. The adjustment of price shall be made according to the above adjustment formula in the following year.
(1) Items are newly-listed new drugs with no prior sales records; and
(2) Items having passed BE studies which has been approved by the competent authority, and are resubmitted for listing.
(3) Adjustment method for drugs with expired patent right or subject to no patent right:

(1) “The weighted average price of drugs in the same grouping and classification (hereinafter referred to as ‘GWAP’)” shall be the target value. The upper limit of the target value of the second category shall be the target value of the first category.
(2) If the WAP is higher or equal to 1.05 times the target value, 1.05 times of the target value should be set as the temporary adjustment price. Where the WAP of a drug is less than 1.05 times the target value, the WAP should be the temporary adjustment price subject to the lower limit of 90% of the target value. Notwithstanding, the temporary adjustment price may not be higher than the reimbursement price prior to the adjustment.
