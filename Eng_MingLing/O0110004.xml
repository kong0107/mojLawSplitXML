    <條號>Article 2</條號>
    <條文內容><![CDATA[Terms used in these Regulations are defined as follows:
I. "Fee payers" means the substance manufacturers and importers officially announced by the central competent authority as subject to soil and groundwater pollution remediation fees.
II. "Chemical substances" means the substances produced via chemical reactions that have been officially announced as subject to soil and groundwater pollution remediation fees.
III. "Direct manufacture raw materials" means raw materials that can be used directly to manufacture substances that have been officially announced by the central competent authority as subject to soil and groundwater pollution remediation fees.
IV. "Exemption ratio" means the percentage ratio between the soil and groundwater pollution remediation fees already paid on direct manufacture raw materials and the soil and groundwater pollution remediation fees assessed on chemical substances that are subject to soil and groundwater pollution remediation fees.
V. "New investment" means newly-added pollution control equipment or facilities, renovation of old pollution control equipment or facilities, and extra pollution control functions added to process equipment; does not include the removal of old equipment or facilities when renovating existing preventive equipment or facilities.
VI. "Substance import volume" means the weight recorded on import declaration forms (in the net weight column).
VII. "Substance production volume" means the sum of amounts of the substance manufactured during the current quarter and recorded on production statements. If the fee category of the substance in question is not waste, and an exemption ratio is not applicable, when remediation fees have already been paid in the current quarter for the raw materials used in that substance's manufacture, the weight of the raw materials for which remediation fees had been paid may be subtracted from the production volume of that substance, and the maximum amount that may be subtracted shall be the production volume of that substance. If fee category of the substance is waste, the production volume must be identical with the sum of the waste output volume reported by that fee payer to the Industrial Waste Control Center Report System for the current quarter.

    <條號>Article 3</條號>
    <條文內容><![CDATA[The central competent authority shall, in consultation with relevant agencies, determine the types of substances for which soil and groundwater remediation fees (herein referred to as remediation fees) must be collected pursuant to Article 28, Paragraph 1 of this Act, fee rates, and industry types, as shown in attached Table 1 and Table 2.
Those substances subject to remediation fees in attached Table 1 in the foregoing paragraph which are chemical substances shall include their isomers in all cases, and fee payers shall report the substances on the basis of their listed chemical substance names.
Four years after the start of fee collection, the central competent authority shall perform a review and propose adjustments to the announced types of substances subject to remediation fees, fee rates, and industry types in view of the actual collection of fees by the Soil and Groundwater Pollution Remediation Fund, on-site investigations, remediation, and the revision of pollution control standards.

    <條號>Article 4</條號>
    <條文內容><![CDATA[Fee payers shall, on their own initiative, pay remediation fees for the previous quarter before the end of each January, April, July and October into a collections account at a financial institution designated by the central competent authority, and shall fill out and submit a report to the central competent authority in the format designated by the latter; the report shall include a completed soil and groundwater pollution remediation fee report, proof of fee payment, and either statistical reports of substance production volume or substance import declaration forms.
If the central competent authority determines through the review of the report in the foregoing paragraph that insufficient fees have been paid, the fee payer shall make up the difference in the next quarter’s payment; if the fee payer has overpaid, the extra portion shall be counted towards subsequent payments.

    <條號>Article 5</條號>
    <條文內容><![CDATA[If a substance subject to remediation fees is a chemical substance, the fee payer may apply to the central competent authority for approval of a exemption ratio by submitting an explanation of the raw materials and processes needed for the manufacture of the chemical substance subject to remediation fees, and providing a detailed list of the cost percentages of raw materials used directly in production and for which remediation fees have already been paid.
The exemption ratios in the foregoing paragraph are calculated as follows.
I. For individual products made from direct manufacture raw materials:
The exemption ratio={Σ[the molecular weight of direct manufacture raw materialx the chemical reaction equation coefficientx the direct manufacture raw material remediation fee rate (NT$/kiloton)]/[(product molecular weight × chemical reaction equation coefficient × product remediation fee rate (NT$/ton)]×100%.
II. For multiple products made from direct manufacture raw materials:
The exemption ratio={Σ[the molecular weight of direct manufacture raw materialx the chemical reaction equation coefficientx the direct manufacture raw material remediation fee rate (NT$/ton)]/[(individual product remediation fee rate (NT$/ton)xΣ(product molecular weightxchemical reaction equation coefficient)]×100%.
III. The exemption ratio for processes that cannot be represented as chemical reaction equations = {Σ[weight of direct manufacture raw material × direct manufacture raw material remediation fee rate (NT$/ton)] / [product weight × product remediation fee rate (NT$/ton)] } × 100%
If the exemption ratio in the foregoing paragraph is greater than 100% when rounded to the second decimal place, it shall be taken to be 100%; molecular weight shall be rounded to the first decimal place.

    <條號>Article 6</條號>
    <條文內容><![CDATA[If a fee payer has applied for an exemption ratio pursuant to the foregoing article, but the central competent authority has not yet approved the exemption ratio, the fee payer shall calculate and pay remediation fees pursuant to Article 7, Paragraph 1, and may not, on its own initiative, calculate an exemption ratio and deduct the amount from payment.
After the central competent authority has approved an exemption ratio, the exemption ratio may be used for as long as the production process and remediation fee rate remain unchanged.
A fee payer that may use an approved exemption ratio to reduce remediation fees shall submit proof that remediation fees have been paid for direct manufacture raw materials. Those that have purchased direct manufacture raw materials from a manufacturer that has already paid remediation fees shall submit proof of purchase of raw materials.

    <條文內容><![CDATA[The amount of quarterly remediation fees due from a fee payer is the grand total of remediation fees for individual substances during the quarter at issue as specified in Paragraph 2.
Amount of remediation fees (NT$) due for individual substances during the current quarter = substance production volume or import volume (tons) × fee rate (NT$/ ton) × (1-exemption ratio).
Figures resulting from the substance production volume or import volume calculations in the foregoing paragraph shall be rounded to the third decimal place.Import calculations shall be based on import volumes of individual substances on import declaration forms; domestic manufacturers shall calculate the grand total of the volume of all individual substances produced during the quarter at issue.
The remediation fees assessed on the individual substances in Paragraph 2 shall be rounded to whole numbers.
