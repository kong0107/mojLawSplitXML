    <條文內容><![CDATA[After taking into consideration sewer-connected users' wastewater or sewage characteristics and wastewater treatment facility treatment capacity, sewage systems must specify the quality of wastewater that may be discharged into the sewage system, must perform regular sampling and testing of the quality of the sewer-connected user's wastewater, must adopt appropriate management based on test results, and must preserve records three years for subsequent reference. However, the regulations of this paragraph concerning water quality shall not apply when a sewer-connected user produces only household sewage.
The sampling and testing in the foregoing paragraph may be performed in a water quality laboratory established by the sewage system, and the testing must be performed employing the methods announced by the central competent authority.
The regular sampling test stated in foregoing paragraph shall test the water quantity and water quality characteristics respectively according to sewer-connected users. However, the competent authority may order the sewage systems to increase sampling items or frequencies for the sewer-connected users based on actual need.
The regulations of foregoing sub-item test are as follows:
I. Sewage systems in science parks and in specific petrochemical areas: water quality items that must be regularly handled the test reporting, must be sampled and tested at least once per quarter
II. Industrial zone sewage system other than those stated in foregoing paragraph: the hydrogen ion concentration index, water temperature, chemical oxygen and suspended solid and the sampling test must be sampled and tested at least once per quarter; other water quality items that must be regularly handled the test reporting, must be sampled and tested at least once every six months
The sewer-connected water quality for the users of the sewer-connected sewage, except for the hydrogen ion concentration index, water temperature, chemical oxygen and suspended solid, other items had been tested and the result was less than the effluent standard for twice consecutively, then such water quality item is exempt from re-test.
Sewage systems must regularly inspect the functioning and operation of wastewater or sewage pre-treatment facilities established by sewer-connected users, provide necessary guidance, and accordance with the inspection result, adopt appropriate management measures, and keep records for three years for subsequent reference.

Such emergency discharge points shall be limited to inlet well overflow outlets or other facilities with the same functions in the original design of the wastewater treatment facility, and may be used to discharge wastewater or sewage only with the consent of the approving agency.
The emergency discharge points in the foregoing paragraph shall be equipped with cumulative water volume measurement facilities and stop valves. Stop valves must have lead seals installed by the competent authority, and the seals must not be removed or destroyed. The stop valves' lead seals may only be removed when emergency discharges must be performed.
When a sewage system discharges wastewater or sewage through the emergency discharge points in the first paragraph, the competent authority must be notified one hour before the discharges, and the sewage system shall keep records, which shall be preserved three years for subsequent reference.
