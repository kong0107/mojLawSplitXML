3. reasonable profit or commission normally realized.
For the case in which products are not imported directly from the country of origin but are exported to this country from a third country, the dumping margin shall be determined by comparing the imported selling price of the products entering into this country and the normal value in the third country pursuant to paragraph 1 above. However, a comparison may be made between the normal value in the country of origin, if the products are merely trans-shipped through the third country, or if such products are not produced in the third country, or if there is no normal value for them in the third country.
When the country of origin or export is a non-market economy, the normal value shall be determined by comparing comparable selling price or constructed value of the like product in a market economy third country, or by comparing comparable selling price of the like product from such a third country to another market economy country, or to this country; or where these are not possible, on such other reasonable basis as may be determined.

1.comparison made between the imported selling price into the country and the normal value, shall be made at the same level of trade and at as nearly as possible the same time. 
2. adjustments shall be made for differences in physical characteristics, taxation, level of trade, transaction time, quantity, terms of sale, and other factors which affect price comparability.

For the case in which the number of foreign producers, exporters, domestic importers, or types of products involved are so large as to make such a determination impracticable, the authorities concerned may limit their investigation either to a reasonable number of interested parties or products, or to parties of the largest percentage of the volume of the exports from the subject country, so as to determine the individual dumping margin for each foreign producer or exporter under investigation.
Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the MOF shall determine an individual dumping margin and applicable duty rate for any foreign producer or exporter not initially selected who submits the necessary information in time, except where the number of producers or exporters is so large as to affect the investigation.

Where any dumping margin established for selected foreign producers or exporters with respect to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph 3 of paragraph 1 of Article 15, or Article 21, such dumping margin shall be disregarded in the calculation of the aforementioned weighted average.
After the final determination is made and upon request, the MOF shall promptly carry out a review to determine individual margins of dumping for any producers or exporters of the exporting country who have not exported the subject product to the domestic market during the period of investigation, provided that these producers or exporters can show that they are not related to any of the producers or exports in the exporting country who are subject to the anti-dumping duties on the product. The MOF may request guarantees equivalent to the amount of the anti-dumping duty from the date of the initiation of the review, and impose the anti-dumping duty on the subject product imported during the period of review based on the individual dumping margin determined.
