1.When applying for drug review and registration, the applicant may firstly prepare the analytical method validation report and the protocol of the validation of critical manufacturing processes.  After receiving approval, the manufacturer should conduct validation studies on three consecutive batches of products.   If the results meet all specified criteria, the product can therefore be marketed.
2.The validation studies should be able to assure drug effectiveness and safety and comply with the Guidelines on GMP Validation Requirements as announced by the central heath competent authority.
3.The contents and schedule of a drug validation process are as follows:
(1)Manufacturers should submit the validation documents of the supporting system, equipment and facility, critical manufacturing processes (including cleaning validation) and analytical method of at least one product to the central health competent authority for inspection.  The submission deadlines were 31 December 2000 for local manufacturers and 10 June 2002 for license holders of imported drugs.  For those failing the submission or the assessment, the authority will make a public list of their company names and all their approved drug licenses in Taiwan, and give a deadline for improvement.  These companies are not allowed to file any applications of new drug registration.  Companies missing the deadline for improvement will be denied the rights to apply for license extension.
(2)Manufacturers should submit the validation documents of the critical manufacturing processes (including cleaning validation) and analytical method of all products to the central health competent authority for inspection.  The submission deadlines were 30 June 2002 for local manufacturers and 10 December 2003 for license holders of imported drugs.  Companies failing the submission or the assessment will be handled according to the proceedings stated in item (1).
(3)Manufacturers should fully implement all validation processes and submit the documents to the central health competent authority for inspection.  The deadlines for submission are 30 June 2004 for local manufacturers and 10 December 2005 for license holders of imported drugs.  Companies failing the submission or the assessment will be handled according to the proceedings stated in Item (1).
(4)Validation would not be necessary for license holders that do not manufacture or import drugs to sell.  This exemption took effect from 1 July 2002 for local drugs and from 11 December 2003 for imported drugs.  However, licenses of imported drugs may be extended without validation, if the license holder submits the drug license and an assurance statement certifying that the drug will be imported for sale only after all validation documents have been submitted and approved.  The license will be stamped, noting that the drug can not be imported due to deficiency of required documents.  After all documents are submitted and approved, the license will be re-stamped, indicating that the drug can now be imported for sale on the grounds that  full compliance has been met with the DOH’s requirements.
(5)Penalties will be imposed on license holders pursuant to the Pharmaceutical Affairs Acts, if drugs have been produced or imported to sell without validation.

1.New chemical entities (NCE); or
2.Items announced by the central health competent authority as requiring a bridging study assessment.
For drugs other than the two categories listed above, whether an application of a bridging study assessment shall be filed is left to the discretion of manufacturers.  For applications without bridging study data, if the central health competent authority considers that a bridging study is necessary, the manufacturer is obliged to conduct a bridging study.
When applying for a bridging study assessment, manufacturers should fill out the checklist for bridging study assessments and provide a complete clinical data package, preferably with data on ethnic groups in Asia.  Applications of bridging study assessments can be filed prior to or together with the applications of drug registration.
Bridging study data would not be required for the applications of drug registration that have been approved by the central health competent authority to be exempt from bridging studies.  However, there should still be sufficient clinical data to justify drug efficacy and safety.
If the assessment result suggests that a bridging study is necessary, the applicant should prepare an appropriate protocol according to the comments from the assessment and submit the protocol to the central health competent authority for assessment.   After the protocol is approved, the applicant should conduct the bridging study and submit study reports and related data to the central health competent authority for inspection.
In situation where a license is granted to a new drug with the submission of bridging study data, if in the next 5 years any generic manufacturer intends to manufacture or import generics with ingredients, dosage form and contents identical to this new drug, then the generic manufacturer should submit all required data and a bridging study report up to the standards set by the first license holder.
